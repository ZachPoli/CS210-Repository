The objective in project 3 was to create a functional GroceryTracker program. The goal was to help users track the frequency of various items from the grocery list. The tools within would allow the user to better understand and manage their grocery inventory.
In crafting the solution, I focused on building an intuitive user interface. The system allowed users to load data from a file, fetch an item's frequency, print the grocery list and a histogram, and backup their data. Although the initial implementation was functional, there is always room for improvement.
The next steps in this project could involve enhancing the error handling to include scenarios like file not found or invalid inputs. This, along with limiting the number of iterations in generating the histogram or searching for an item, could make the code more efficient, secure, and robust.

One of the biggest challenges during the project was dealing with file handling operations and mapping the data into a structured format. I resolved this issue by leaning heavily on resources such as the C++ documentation and various online guides to comprehend the intricacies of the ifstream class and the STL map container. This experience underscored the significance of continuous learning and the effective utilization of resources, which I plan to incorporate into my data analyst toolkit.

The skills acquired and refined during this project, like file handling, user input validation, usage of STL containers, and object-oriented programming, will undoubtedly be beneficial for future projects and coursework. A key emphasis of mine was to ensure the program was maintainable, readable, and adaptable. By adhering to a modular approach, consistent formatting, descriptive variable naming, and comprehensive inline comments, I was able to create maintainable and readable code. The usage of object-oriented programming and the map data structure ensured the adaptability of the program. This approach not only helps to track additional attributes of grocery items if needed in the future but also epitomizes the adaptable and reusable code that every software development project should strive for.
